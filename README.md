#Simple Surf Report

This assignment is to make a simple Surf Report application by using the buoy data provided by NOAA. The data feed is a simple tab delimited file that contains wind & swell data for the last 45 days. 
To simplify this assignment, we will be focusing on a single buoy off the coast of Oregon. The data feed for this buoy can be found here:

The description for what each column means can be found here: https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/waveobs.shtml
